                        <p> Nowadays IT education is an essential education for upcoming future. Information</p>
                        <p> Technology has become a fastest growing industry in today's scenario which is providing</p>
                        <p> thousands of job to well trained professionals.</p>
                        <p>  </p>
                        <p>In this point of view we try to provide depth full computer education with a good </p>
                        <p>infrastructure knowledge. The main objective behind the establishment of this institution</p>
                        <p> is to spread the digital lteracy program. Our institution try to care upon the growing</p>
                        <p> future of IT professionals. There are millions of people who can only dream about Computer Education</p>
                        <p>  </p>
                        <p>COMPURASS is helping some of them to realize this dream. I personally trust without (DDH)</p>
                        <p>Dedication- Discipline-Hardwork no one can got success in his/her lfe. From this point of </p>
                        <p>view I ensure this intitute sholud care about DDH(not only students our group of faculty  </p>
                        <p>also maintain this). I also as Centre Co-ordinator of COMPURASS ensure that no one will illiterate</p>
                        <p> for financial problem till our existent, our well equipped computer lab help students to move forrward</p>
                        <p>to get professionals competence. I wish for their great success and bright future and hope their better tomorrow.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Previoulsy when all facd the tough position (COVID-19) we stand with guardians and students and </p>
                        <p> try to help them financially also by announcing that the lock down period's half month or full</p>
                        <p> month classes fees waved. After COVID-19 period if any existing students got financial crises we support them.</p> 
                        <p>  </p>
                        <p> I personally also want from our respected guardians, if you have any constructive idea which you think</p> 
                        <p>may upkeep our Centre, you are always welcome to share it with us.</p>
